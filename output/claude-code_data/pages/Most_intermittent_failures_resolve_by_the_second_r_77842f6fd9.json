The instruction file (forms.md) references the script, and Claude can execute it without loading its contents into context.\n\n**Important distinction**: Make clear in your instructions whether Claude should:\n- **Execute the script** (most common): \"Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields\"\n- **Read it as reference** (for complex logic): \"See `analyze_form.py` for the field extraction algorithm\"\n\nFor most utility scripts, execution is preferred because it's more reliable and efficient. See the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section below for details on how script execution works.\n\n**Example**:",
