You can use these addresses to configure your firewall rules for secure access to the Claude API and Console. These addresses will not change without notice.\n\n## Inbound IP addresses\n\nThese are the IP addresses where Anthropic services receive incoming connections.\n\n## Outbound IP addresses\n\nThese are the stable IP addresses that Anthropic uses for outbound requests (for example, when making MCP tool calls to external servers).\n\n*The following individual IP addresses are still in use, but will be phased out starting January 15, 2026.*",
