Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.\n\nThe number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.\n\nLearn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)\n\n- `message_batch_id: str`\n\nID of the Message Batch.\n\n- `betas: Optional[List[AnthropicBetaParam]]`\n\nOptional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.\n\n- `UnionMember0 = str`\n\n- `UnionMember1 = Literal[\"message-batches-2024-09-24\", \"prompt-caching-2024-07-31\", \"computer-use-2024-10-22\", 16 more]`\n\n- `\"message-batches-2024-09-24\"`\n\n- `\"prompt-caching-2024-07-31\"`\n\n- `\"computer-use-2024-10-22\"`\n\n- `\"computer-use-2025-01-24\"`\n\n- `\"pdfs-2024-09-25\"`\n\n- `\"token-counting-2024-11-01\"`\n\n- `\"token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19\"`\n\n- `\"output-128k-2025-02-19\"`\n\n- `\"files-api-2025-04-14\"`\n\n- `\"mcp-client-2025-04-04\"`\n\n- `\"mcp-client-2025-11-20\"`\n\n- `\"dev-full-thinking-2025-05-14\"`\n\n- `\"interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14\"`\n\n- `\"code-execution-2025-05-22\"`\n\n- `\"extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11\"`\n\n- `\"context-1m-2025-08-07\"`\n\n- `\"context-management-2025-06-27\"`\n\n- `\"model-context-window-exceeded-2025-08-26\"`\n\n- `\"skills-2025-10-02\"`\n\n- `class BetaMessageBatch: …`\n\nUnique object identifier.\n\nThe format and length of IDs may change over time.\n\n- `archived_at: Optional[datetime]`\n\nRFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived and its results became unavailable.\n\n- `cancel_initiated_at: Optional[datetime]`\n\nRFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated for the Message Batch.
