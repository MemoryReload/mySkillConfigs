Always use the exact beta feature name as documented.\n\nIf you use an invalid or unavailable beta header, you'll receive an error response:\n\nFor questions about beta features:\n\n1. Check the documentation for the specific feature\n2. Review the [API changelog](/docs/en/api/versioning) for updates\n3. Contact support for assistance with production usage\n\nRemember that beta features are provided \"as-is\" and may not have the same SLA guarantees as stable API features.",
