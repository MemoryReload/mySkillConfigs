  "content": "Anthropic provides a compatibility layer that enables you to use the OpenAI SDK to test the Claude API. With a few code changes, you can quickly evaluate Anthropic model capabilities.\n\n<Note>\nThis compatibility layer is primarily intended to test and compare model capabilities, and is not considered a long-term or production-ready solution for most use cases. While we do intend to keep it fully functional and not make breaking changes, our priority is the reliability and effectiveness of the [Claude API](/docs/en/api/overview).\n\nFor more information on known compatibility limitations, see [Important OpenAI compatibility limitations](#important-openai-compatibility-limitations).\n\nIf you encounter any issues with the OpenAI SDK compatibility feature, please let us know [here](https://forms.gle/oQV4McQNiuuNbz9n8).\n</Note>\n\n<Tip>\nFor the best experience and access to Claude API full feature set ([PDF processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support), [citations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations), [extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking), and [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)), we recommend using the native [Claude API](/docs/en/api/overview).\n</Tip>\n\n## Getting started with the OpenAI SDK\n\nTo use the OpenAI SDK compatibility feature, you'll need to:\n\n1. Use an official OpenAI SDK  \n2. Change the following  \n   * Update your base URL to point to the Claude API  \n   * Replace your API key with an [Claude API key](/settings/keys)  \n   * Update your model name to use a [Claude model](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview)  \n3. Review the documentation below for what features are supported\n\n### Quick start example\n\n<CodeGroup>\n    \n    \n    \n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Important OpenAI compatibility limitations\n\nHere are the most substantial differences from using OpenAI:\n\n* The `strict` parameter for function calling is ignored, which means the tool use JSON is not guaranteed to follow the supplied schema. For guaranteed schema conformance, use the native [Claude API with Structured Outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs).\n* Audio input is not supported; it will simply be ignored and stripped from input  \n* Prompt caching is not supported, but it is supported in [the Anthropic SDK](/docs/en/api/client-sdks)  \n* System/developer messages are hoisted and concatenated to the beginning of the conversation, as Anthropic only supports a single initial system message.\n\nMost unsupported fields are silently ignored rather than producing errors. These are all documented below.\n\n#### Output quality considerations\n\nIf you’ve done lots of tweaking to your prompt, it’s likely to be well-tuned to OpenAI specifically. Consider using our [prompt improver in the Claude Console](/dashboard) as a good starting point.\n\n#### System / Developer message hoisting\n\nMost of the inputs to the OpenAI SDK clearly map directly to Anthropic’s API parameters, but one distinct difference is the handling of system / developer prompts. These two prompts can be put throughout a chat conversation via OpenAI. Since Anthropic only supports an initial system message, we take all system/developer messages and concatenate them together with a single newline (`\\n`) in between them. This full string is then supplied as a single system message at the start of the messages.\n\n#### Extended thinking support\n\nYou can enable [extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) capabilities by adding the `thinking` parameter. While this will improve Claude's reasoning for complex tasks, the OpenAI SDK won't return Claude's detailed thought process. For full extended thinking features, including access to Claude's step-by-step reasoning output, use the native Claude API.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n    \n    \n    \n</CodeGroup>\n\nRate limits follow Anthropic's [standard limits](/docs/en/api/rate-limits) for the `/v1/messages` endpoint.\n\n## Detailed OpenAI Compatible API Support\n### Request fields\n#### Simple fields\n| Field | Support status |\n|--------|----------------|\n| `model` | Use Claude model names |\n| `max_tokens` | Fully supported |\n| `max_completion_tokens` | Fully supported |\n| `stream` | Fully supported |\n| `stream_options` | Fully supported |\n| `top_p` | Fully supported |\n| `parallel_tool_calls` | Fully supported |\n| `stop` | All non-whitespace stop sequences work |\n| `temperature` | Between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

However, the detailed error messages will not be equivalent. We recommend only using the error messages for logging and debugging.\n\n### Header compatibility\n\nWhile the OpenAI SDK automatically manages headers, here is the complete list of headers supported by the Claude API for developers who need to work with them directly.\n\n| Header | Support Status |\n|---------|----------------|\n| `x-ratelimit-limit-requests` | Fully supported |\n| `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` | Fully supported |\n| `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests` | Fully supported |\n| `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens` | Fully supported |\n| `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` | Fully supported |\n| `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens` | Fully supported |\n| `retry-after` | Fully supported |\n| `request-id` | Fully supported |\n| `openai-version` | Always `2020-10-01` |\n| `authorization` | Fully supported |\n| `openai-processing-ms` | Always empty |",
