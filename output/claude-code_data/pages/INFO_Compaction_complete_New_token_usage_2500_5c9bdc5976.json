Performing compaction.\n// Compaction complete. New token usage: 2500\n```\n\n### When to use compaction\n\n- Long-running agent tasks that process many files or data sources\n- Research workflows that accumulate large amounts of information\n- Multi-step tasks with clear, measurable progress\n- Tasks that produce artifacts (files, reports) that persist outside the conversation\n\n**Less ideal use cases:**\n\n- Tasks requiring precise recall of early conversation details\n- Workflows using server-side tools extensively\n- Tasks that need to maintain exact state across many variables",
