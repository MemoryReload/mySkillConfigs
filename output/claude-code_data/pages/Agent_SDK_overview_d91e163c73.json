  "content": "Build production AI agents with Claude Code as a library\n\n<Note>\nThe Claude Code SDK has been renamed to the Claude Agent SDK. If you're migrating from the old SDK, see the [Migration Guide](/docs/en/agent-sdk/migration-guide).\n</Note>\n\nBuild AI agents that autonomously read files, run commands, search the web, edit code, and more. The Agent SDK gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code, programmable in Python and TypeScript.\n\nThe Agent SDK includes built-in tools for reading files, running commands, and editing code, so your agent can start working immediately without you implementing tool execution. Dive into the quickstart or explore real agents built with the SDK:\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Quickstart\" icon=\"play\" href=\"/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart\">\n    Build a bug-fixing agent in minutes\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Example agents\" icon=\"star\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-demos\">\n    Email assistant, research agent, and more\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\nEverything that makes Claude Code powerful is available in the SDK:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Built-in tools\">\n    Your agent can read files, run commands, and search codebases out of the box. Key tools include:\n\n| Tool | What it does |\n    |------|--------------|\n    | **Read** | Read any file in the working directory |\n    | **Write** | Create new files |\n    | **Edit** | Make precise edits to existing files |\n    | **Bash** | Run terminal commands, scripts, git operations |\n    | **Glob** | Find files by pattern (`**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.py`) |\n    | **Grep** | Search file contents with regex |\n    | **WebSearch** | Search the web for current information |\n    | **WebFetch** | Fetch and parse web page content |\n    | **[AskUserQuestion](/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions)** | Ask the user clarifying questions with multiple choice options |\n\nThis example creates an agent that searches your codebase for TODO comments:\n\n</Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Hooks\">\n    Run custom code at key points in the agent lifecycle. SDK hooks use callback functions to validate, log, block, or transform agent behavior.\n\n**Available hooks:** `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and more.\n\nThis example logs all file changes to an audit file:\n\n[Learn more about hooks →](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks)\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Subagents\">\n    Spawn specialized agents to handle focused subtasks. Your main agent delegates work, and subagents report back with results.\n\nDefine custom agents with specialized instructions.

To use these features, set `setting_sources=[\"project\"]` (Python) or `settingSources: ['project']` (TypeScript)  in your options.\n\n| Feature | Description | Location |\n|---------|-------------|----------|\n| [Skills](/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills) | Specialized capabilities defined in Markdown | `.claude/skills/SKILL.md` |\n| [Slash commands](/docs/en/agent-sdk/slash-commands) | Custom commands for common tasks | `.claude/commands/*.md` |\n| [Memory](/docs/en/agent-sdk/modifying-system-prompts) | Project context and instructions | `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` |\n| [Plugins](/docs/en/agent-sdk/plugins) | Extend with custom commands, agents, and MCP servers | Programmatic via `plugins` option |\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Install Claude Code\">\n    The SDK uses Claude Code as its runtime:\n\n<Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"macOS/Linux/WSL\">\n        \n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"Homebrew\">\n        \n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"WinGet\">\n        \n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\nSee [Claude Code setup](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) for Windows and other options.\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Install the SDK\">\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\n        \n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"Python\">\n        \n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Set your API key\">\n    \n    Get your key from the [Console](https://platform.claude.com/).\n\nThe SDK also supports authentication via third-party API providers:\n\n- **Amazon Bedrock**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` environment variable and configure AWS credentials\n    - **Google Vertex AI**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1` environment variable and configure Google Cloud credentials\n    - **Microsoft Foundry**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1` environment variable and configure Azure credentials\n\n<Note>\n    Unless previously approved, we do not allow third party developers to offer Claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Please use the API key authentication methods described in this document instead.\n    </Note>\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Run your first agent\">\n    This example creates an agent that lists files in your current directory using built-in tools.\n\n</CodeGroup>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n**Ready to build?** Follow the [Quickstart](/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart) to create an agent that finds and fixes bugs in minutes.\n\n## Compare the Agent SDK to other Claude tools\n\nThe Claude platform offers multiple ways to build with Claude. Here's how the Agent SDK fits in:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Agent SDK vs Client SDK\">\n    The [Anthropic Client SDK](/docs/en/api/client-sdks) gives you direct API access: you send prompts and implement tool execution yourself. The **Agent SDK** gives you Claude with built-in tool execution.\n\nWith the Client SDK, you implement a tool loop. With the Agent SDK, Claude handles it:\n\n</CodeGroup>\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI\">\n    Same capabilities, different interface:\n\n| Use case | Best choice |\n    |----------|-------------|\n    | Interactive development | CLI |\n    | CI/CD pipelines | SDK |\n    | Custom applications | SDK |\n    | One-off tasks | CLI |\n    | Production automation | SDK |\n\nMany teams use both: CLI for daily development, SDK for production. Workflows translate directly between them.\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nView the full changelog for SDK updates, bug fixes, and new features:\n\n- **TypeScript SDK**: [view CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n- **Python SDK**: [view CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n\nIf you encounter bugs or issues with the Agent SDK:\n\n- **TypeScript SDK**: [report issues on GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/issues)\n- **Python SDK**: [report issues on GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues)\n\n## Branding guidelines\n\nFor partners integrating the Claude Agent SDK, use of Claude branding is optional. When referencing Claude in your product:\n\n**Allowed:**\n- \"Claude Agent\" (preferred for dropdown menus)\n- \"Claude\" (when within a menu already labeled \"Agents\")\n- \"{YourAgentName} Powered by Claude\" (if you have an existing agent name)\n\n**Not permitted:**\n- \"Claude Code\" or \"Claude Code Agent\"\n- Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code\n\nYour product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code or any Anthropic product. For questions about branding compliance, contact our [sales team](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales).\n\nUse of the Claude Agent SDK is governed by [Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms), including when you use it to power products and services that you make available to your own customers and end users, except to the extent a specific component or dependency is covered by a different license as indicated in that component's LICENSE file.\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Quickstart\" icon=\"play\" href=\"/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart\">\n    Build an agent that finds and fixes bugs in minutes\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Example agents\" icon=\"star\" href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-demos\">\n    Email assistant, research agent, and more\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"TypeScript SDK\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript\">\n    Full TypeScript API reference and examples\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Python SDK\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/docs/en/agent-sdk/python\">\n    Full Python API reference and examples\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
