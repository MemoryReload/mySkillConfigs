The text data is then cleaned by removing extra whitespace and page numbers.\n\n### Build a strong prompt\n\nClaude can adapt to various summarization styles. You can change the details of the prompt to guide Claude to be more or less verbose, include more or less technical terminology, or provide a higher or lower level summary of the context at hand. \n\nHere’s an example of how to create a prompt that ensures the generated summaries follow a consistent structure when analyzing sublease agreements:",
