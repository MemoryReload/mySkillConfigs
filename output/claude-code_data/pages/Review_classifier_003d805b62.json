Your goal is to analyze each piece of feedback, assign the most relevant categories, and determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each category based on the feedback content.

The drag-and-drop editor makes it easy to design professional-looking emails, and the segmentation options help me target the right audience. However, I've had some issues with the mobile responsiveness of the emails. Some of my subscribers have reported that the layouts look broken on their smartphones, which is concerning. I'd love to see improvements in this area. Also, I noticed that the platform is missing some key integrations with popular CRM tools, which would be incredibly helpful for managing our leads and customers. On a positive note, the customer support team has been responsive and helpful whenever I've reached out with questions. Overall, it's a great tool, but there's definitely room for improvement in terms of mobile compatibility and third-party integrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n> Categories:\n>\n> - Product Features and Functionality\n>   - Core Features - Positive\n>     User Experience and Design\n>   - Ease of Use - Positive\n>   - Visual Design and Aesthetics - Positive\n> - Mobile and Cross-Platform Compatibility\n>   - Mobile App Functionality - Negative\n>   - Responsive Design - Negative\n>   - Device and OS Compatibility - Negative\n> - Third-Party Integrations and API\n>   - Integration Functionality and Reliability - Negative\n> - Customer Support and Service\n>   - Responsiveness and Availability - Positive\n>   - Issue Resolution and Follow-up - Positive\n\n<CodeGroup>\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n</CodeGroup>",
