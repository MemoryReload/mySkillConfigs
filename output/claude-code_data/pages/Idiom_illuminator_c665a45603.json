It is an ironic expression, as breaking a leg would be a disastrous event for a performer.\n\nOrigin: There are several theories about the origin of this idiom. One theory suggests that it comes from the superstition that wishing someone good luck directly would jinx the performance, so an ironic phrase was used instead. Another theory traces the origin to the ancient Greek theater, where audiences would stomp their feet and break twigs to applaud a good performance. The more broken twigs, the better the performance. Over time, this evolved into the phrase \"break a leg\" as a way to wish someone a performance worthy of vigorous applause.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"Python\">\n`\n</Tab>\n<Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab title=\"AWS Bedrock Python\">\n\n```python\nfrom anthropic import AnthropicBedrock",
