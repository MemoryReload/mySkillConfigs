This allows Claude to directly interact with your files, providing hands-on assistance rather than just suggesting changes.\n\n## Model compatibility\n\n| Model | Tool Version |\n|-------|--------------|\n| Claude 4.x models | `text_editor_20250728` |\n| Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)) | `text_editor_20250124` |\n\n<Warning>\nThe `text_editor_20250728` tool for Claude 4 models does not include the `undo_edit` command. If you require this functionality, you'll need to use Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)).\n</Warning>\n\n<Warning>\nOlder tool versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models. Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version.\n</Warning>\n\n## When to use the text editor tool\n\nSome examples of when to use the text editor tool are:\n- **Code debugging**: Have Claude identify and fix bugs in your code, from syntax errors to logic issues.\n- **Code refactoring**: Let Claude improve your code structure, readability, and performance through targeted edits.\n- **Documentation generation**: Ask Claude to add docstrings, comments, or README files to your codebase.\n- **Test creation**: Have Claude create unit tests for your code based on its understanding of the implementation.\n\n## Use the text editor tool\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"Claude 4\">\nProvide the text editor tool (named `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) to Claude using the Messages API.\n\nYou can optionally specify a `max_characters` parameter to control truncation when viewing large files.\n\n<Note>\n`max_characters` is only compatible with `text_editor_20250728` and later versions of the text editor tool.\n</Note>\n\n</CodeGroup>\n</Tab>\n<Tab title=\"Claude Sonnet 3.7\">\nProvide the text editor tool (named `str_replace_editor`) to Claude using the Messages API:\n<CodeGroup>\n\n</CodeGroup>\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nThe text editor tool can be used in the following way:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Provide Claude with the text editor tool and a user prompt\">\n    - Include the text editor tool in your API request\n    - Provide a user prompt that may require examining or modifying files, such as \"Can you fix the syntax error in my code?\"\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Claude uses the tool to examine files or directories\">\n    - Claude assesses what it needs to look at and uses the `view` command to examine file contents or list directory contents\n    - The API response will contain a `tool_use` content block with the `view` command\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Execute the view command and return results\">\n    - Extract the file or directory path from Claude's tool use request\n    - Read the file's contents or list the directory contents\n    - If a `max_characters` parameter was specified in the tool configuration, truncate the file contents to that length\n    - Return the results to Claude by continuing the conversation with a new `user` message containing a `tool_result` content block\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Claude uses the tool to modify files\">\n    - After examining the file or directory, Claude may use a command such as `str_replace` to make changes or `insert` to add text at a specific line number.\n    - If Claude uses the `str_replace` command, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request with the old text and new text to replace it with\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Execute the edit and return results\">\n    - Extract the file path, old text, and new text from Claude's tool use request\n    - Perform the text replacement in the file\n    - Return the results to Claude\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Claude provides its analysis and explanation\">\n    - After examining and possibly editing the files, Claude provides a complete explanation of what it found and what changes it made\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Text editor tool commands\n\nThe text editor tool supports several commands for viewing and modifying files:\n\nThe `view` command allows Claude to examine the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. It can read the entire file or a specific range of lines.\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: Must be \"view\"\n- `path`: The path to the file or directory to view\n- `view_range` (optional): An array of two integers specifying the start and end line numbers to view. Line numbers are 1-indexed, and -1 for the end line means read to the end of the file. This parameter only applies when viewing files, not directories.\n\n<section title=\"Example view commands\">\n\nThe `str_replace` command allows Claude to replace a specific string in a file with a new string. This is used for making precise edits.\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: Must be \"str_replace\"\n- `path`: The path to the file to modify\n- `old_str`: The text to replace (must match exactly, including whitespace and indentation)\n- `new_str`: The new text to insert in place of the old text\n\n<section title=\"Example str_replace command\">\n\nThe `create` command allows Claude to create a new file with specified content.\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: Must be \"create\"\n- `path`: The path where the new file should be created\n- `file_text`: The content to write to the new file\n\n<section title=\"Example create command\">\n\nThe `insert` command allows Claude to insert text at a specific location in a file.\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: Must be \"insert\"\n- `path`: The path to the file to modify\n- `insert_line`: The line number after which to insert the text (0 for beginning of file)\n- `new_str`: The text to insert\n\n<section title=\"Example insert command\">\n\nThe `undo_edit` command allows Claude to revert the last edit made to a file.\n\n<Note>\nThis command is only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)). It is not supported in Claude 4 models using the `text_editor_20250728`.\n</Note>\n\nParameters:\n- `command`: Must be \"undo_edit\"\n- `path`: The path to the file whose last edit should be undone\n\n<section title=\"Example undo_edit command\">\n\n### Example: Fixing a syntax error with the text editor tool\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"Claude 4\">\n\nThis example demonstrates how Claude 4 models use the text editor tool to fix a syntax error in a Python file.\n\nFirst, your application provides Claude with the text editor tool and a prompt to fix a syntax error:\n\nClaude will use the text editor tool first to view the file:\n\nYour application should then read the file and return its contents to Claude:\n\n<Tip>\n**Line numbers**\n\nIn the example above, the `view` tool result includes file contents with line numbers prepended to each line (e.g., \"1: def is_prime(n):\"). Line numbers are not required, but they are essential for successfully using the `view_range` parameter to examine specific sections of files and the `insert_line` parameter to add content at precise locations.\n</Tip>\n\nClaude will identify the syntax error and use the `str_replace` command to fix it:\n\nYour application should then make the edit and return the result:\n\nFinally, Claude will provide a complete explanation of the fix:\n\npython\\nfor num in range(2, limit + 1)\\npython\\nfor num in range(2, limit + 1):\\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Claude Sonnet 3.7\">\nThis example demonstrates how Claude Sonnet 3.7 uses the text editor tool to fix a syntax error in a Python file.\n\nFirst, your application provides Claude with the text editor tool and a prompt to fix a syntax error:\n\n<Note>\nThe Claude Sonnet 3.7 examples follow the same format as the Claude 4 examples above, using the same tool calls and responses but with the `text_editor_20250124` tool type and `str_replace_editor` name.\n</Note>\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Implement the text editor tool\n\nThe text editor tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, you don't need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into Claude's model and can't be modified.\n\nThe tool type depends on the model version:\n- **Claude 4**: `type: \"text_editor_20250728\"`\n- **Claude Sonnet 3.7**: `type: \"text_editor_20250124\"`\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Initialize your editor implementation\">\n    Create helper functions to handle file operations like reading, writing, and modifying files. Consider implementing backup functionality to recover from mistakes.\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Handle editor tool calls\">\n    Create a function that processes tool calls from Claude based on the command type:\n    \n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Implement security measures\">\n    Add validation and security checks:\n    - Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal\n    - Create backups before making changes\n    - Handle errors gracefully\n    - Implement permissions checks\n  </Step>\n  <Step title=\"Process Claude's responses\">\n    Extract and handle tool calls from Claude's responses:\n    \n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Warning>\nWhen implementing the text editor tool, keep in mind:\n\n1. **Security**: The tool has access to your local filesystem, so implement proper security measures.\n2. **Backup**: Always create backups before allowing edits to important files.\n3. **Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent unintended changes.\n4. **Unique matching**: Make sure replacements match exactly one location to avoid unintended edits.\n</Warning>\n\nWhen using the text editor tool, various errors may occur. Here is guidance on how to handle them:\n\n<section title=\"File not found\">\n\nIf Claude tries to view or modify a file that doesn't exist, return an appropriate error message in the `tool_result`:\n\n<section title=\"Multiple matches for replacement\">\n\nIf Claude's `str_replace` command matches multiple locations in the file, return an appropriate error message:\n\n<section title=\"No matches for replacement\">\n\nIf Claude's `str_replace` command doesn't match any text in the file, return an appropriate error message:\n\n<section title=\"Permission errors\">\n\nIf there are permission issues with creating, reading, or modifying files, return an appropriate error message:\n\n### Follow implementation best practices\n\n<section title=\"Provide clear context\">\n\nWhen asking Claude to fix or modify code, be specific about what files need to be examined or what issues need to be addressed. Clear context helps Claude identify the right files and make appropriate changes.\n\n**Less helpful prompt**: \"Can you fix my code?\"\n\n**Better prompt**: \"There's a syntax error in my primes.py file that prevents it from running. Can you fix it?\"\n\n<section title=\"Be explicit about file paths\">\n\nSpecify file paths clearly when needed, especially if you're working with multiple files or files in different directories.\n\n**Less helpful prompt**: \"Review my helper file\"\n\n**Better prompt**: \"Can you check my utils/helpers.py file for any performance issues?\"\n\n<section title=\"Create backups before editing\">\n\nImplement a backup system in your application that creates copies of files before allowing Claude to edit them, especially for important or production code.\n\n<section title=\"Handle unique text replacement carefully\">\n\nThe `str_replace` command requires an exact match for the text to be replaced. Your application should ensure that there is exactly one match for the old text or provide appropriate error messages.\n\n<section title=\"Verify changes\">\n\nAfter Claude makes changes to a file, verify the changes by running tests or checking that the code still works as expected.\n\n## Pricing and token usage\n\nThe text editor tool uses the same pricing structure as other tools used with Claude. It follows the standard input and output token pricing based on the Claude model you're using.\n\nIn addition to the base tokens, the following additional input tokens are needed for the text editor tool:\n\n| Tool | Additional input tokens |\n| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| `text_editor_20250429` (Claude 4.x) | 700 tokens |\n| `text_editor_20250124` (Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))) | 700 tokens |\n\nFor more detailed information about tool pricing, see [Tool use pricing](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#pricing).\n\n## Integrate the text editor tool with other tools\n\nThe text editor tool can be used alongside other Claude tools. When combining tools, ensure you:\n- Match the tool version with the model you're using\n- Account for the additional token usage for all tools included in your request\n\n| Date | Version | Changes |\n| ---- | ------- | ------- |\n| July 28, 2025 | `text_editor_20250728` | Release of an updated text editor Tool that fixes some issues and adds an optional `max_characters` parameter. It is otherwise identical to `text_editor_20250429`. |\n| April 29, 2025 | `text_editor_20250429` | Release of the text editor Tool for Claude 4. This version removes the `undo_edit` command but maintains all other capabilities. The tool name has been updated to reflect its str_replace-based architecture. |\n| March 13, 2025 | `text_editor_20250124` | Introduction of standalone text editor Tool documentation. This version is optimized for Claude Sonnet 3.7 but has identical capabilities to the previous version. |\n| October 22, 2024 | `text_editor_20241022` | Initial release of the text editor Tool with Claude Sonnet 3.5 ([retired](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)). Provides capabilities for viewing, creating, and editing files through the `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, and `undo_edit` commands. |\n\nHere are some ideas for how to use the text editor tool in more convenient and powerful ways:\n\n- **Integrate with your development workflow**: Build the text editor tool into your development tools or IDE\n- **Create a code review system**: Have Claude review your code and make improvements\n- **Build a debugging assistant**: Create a system where Claude can help you diagnose and fix issues in your code\n- **Implement file format conversion**: Let Claude help you convert files from one format to another\n- **Automate documentation**: Set up workflows for Claude to automatically document your code\n\nAs you build applications with the text editor tool, we're excited to see how you leverage Claude's capabilities to enhance your development workflow and productivity.\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Tool use overview\"\n    icon=\"wrench\"\n    href=\"/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview\"\n  >\n    Learn how to implement tool workflows for use with Claude.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card\n    title=\"Bash tool\"\n    icon=\"terminal\"\n    href=\"/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/bash-tool\"\n  >\n    Execute shell commands with Claude.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>",
