  "content": "Batch processing is a powerful approach for handling large volumes of requests efficiently. Instead of processing requests one at a time with immediate responses, batch processing allows you to submit multiple requests together for asynchronous processing. This pattern is particularly useful when:\n\n- You need to process large volumes of data\n- Immediate responses are not required\n- You want to optimize for cost efficiency\n- You're running large-scale evaluations or analyses\n\nThe Message Batches API is our first implementation of this pattern.",
