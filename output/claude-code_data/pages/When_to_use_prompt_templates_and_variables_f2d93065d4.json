  "title": "When to use prompt templates and variables",
  "content": "You should always use prompt templates and variables when you expect any part of your prompt to be repeated in another call to Claude (only via the API or the [Claude Console](/). [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) currently does not support prompt templates or variables).\n\nPrompt templates offer several benefits:\n- **Consistency:** Ensure a consistent structure for your prompts across multiple interactions\n- **Efficiency:** Easily swap out variable content without rewriting the entire prompt\n- **Testability:** Quickly test different inputs and edge cases by changing only the variable portion\n- **Scalability:** Simplify prompt management as your application grows in complexity\n- **Version control:** Easily track changes to your prompt structure over time by keeping tabs only on the core part of your prompt, separate from dynamic inputs\n\nThe [Claude Console](/) heavily uses prompt templates and variables in order to support features and tooling for all the above, such as with the:\n- **[Prompt generator](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator):** Decides what variables your prompt needs and includes them in the template it outputs\n- **[Prompt improver](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver):** Takes your existing template, including all variables, and maintains them in the improved template it outputs\n- **[Evaluation tool](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/eval-tool):** Allows you to easily test, scale, and track versions of your prompts by separating the variable and fixed portions of your prompt template",
