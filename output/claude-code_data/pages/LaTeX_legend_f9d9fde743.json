The header row should contain the titles \"Name,\" \"Age,\" and \"City.\" The data row should have the values \"John,\" \"25,\" and \"New York.\"                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\nHere's the LaTeX code to create a simple table with three columns and two rows, including a header row with the titles \"Name,\" \"Age,\" and \"City,\" and a data row with the values \"John,\" \"25,\" and \"New York\":\n\n- The `table` environment is used to create a floating table that can be positioned automatically by LaTeX.\n- The optional `[h]` parameter suggests to LaTeX to place the table \"here\" in the document flow, if possible.\n- The `\\centering` command centers the table horizontally on the page.\n- The `tabular` environment is used to create the actual table structure.\n- The `{|c|c|c|}` argument specifies three centered columns (`c`) separated by vertical lines (`|`).\n- The `\\hline` command adds horizontal lines to separate the header row from the data rows and to frame the table.\n- The `&` character separates the cells within a row, and `\\\\` marks the end of a row.\n- The `\\caption` command adds a caption to the table, which will be labeled as \"Sample Table\" in this example.\n- The `\\label` command assigns a label to the table, which can be used for cross-referencing within your document.\n\nWhen you compile your LaTeX document, this code will generate a table that looks like this:\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"Python\">\n`\n</Tab>\n<Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\n`\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab title=\"AWS Bedrock Python\">\n```python\nfrom anthropic import AnthropicBedrock",
