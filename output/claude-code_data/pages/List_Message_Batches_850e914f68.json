When provided, returns the page of results immediately after this object.\n\n- `before_id: optional string`\n\nID of the object to use as a cursor for pagination. When provided, returns the page of results immediately before this object.\n\n- `limit: optional number`\n\nNumber of items to return per page.\n\nDefaults to `20`. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.\n\n- `data: array of MessageBatch`\n\nUnique object identifier.\n\nThe format and length of IDs may change over time.\n\n- `archived_at: string`\n\nRFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived and its results became unavailable.\n\n- `cancel_initiated_at: string`\n\nRFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated for the Message Batch. Specified only if cancellation was initiated.\n\n- `created_at: string`\n\nRFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.\n\nRFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended.

The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.\n\nNumber of requests in the Message Batch that have been canceled.\n\nThis is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.\n\nNumber of requests in the Message Batch that encountered an error.\n\nThis is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.\n\nNumber of requests in the Message Batch that have expired.\n\nThis is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.\n\n- `processing: number`\n\nNumber of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.\n\n- `succeeded: number`\n\nNumber of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.\n\nThis is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.\n\n- `results_url: string`\n\nURL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.\n\nResults in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.\n\n- `type: \"message_batch\"`\n\nFor Message Batches, this is always `\"message_batch\"`.\n\nFirst ID in the `data` list. Can be used as the `before_id` for the previous page.\n\n- `has_more: boolean`\n\nIndicates if there are more results in the requested page direction.\n\nLast ID in the `data` list.
