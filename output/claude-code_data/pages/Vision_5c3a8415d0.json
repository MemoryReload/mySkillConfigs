  "content": "Claude's vision capabilities allow it to understand and analyze images, opening up exciting possibilities for multimodal interaction.\n\nThis guide describes how to work with images in Claude, including best practices, code examples, and limitations to keep in mind.\n\nUse Claude’s vision capabilities via:\n\n- [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/). Upload an image like you would a file, or drag and drop an image directly into the chat window.\n- The [Console Workbench](/workbench/). A button to add images appears at the top right of every User message block.\n- **API request**. See the examples in this guide.\n\n### Basics and Limits\n\nYou can include multiple images in a single request (up to 20 for [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) and 100 for API requests). Claude will analyze all provided images when formulating its response. This can be helpful for comparing or contrasting images.\n\nIf you submit an image larger than 8000x8000 px, it will be rejected. If you submit more than 20 images in one API request, this limit is 2000x2000 px.\n\n<Note>\nWhile the API supports 100 images per request, there is a [32MB request size limit](/docs/en/api/overview#request-size-limits) for standard endpoints.\n</Note>\n\n### Evaluate image size\n\nFor optimal performance, we recommend resizing images before uploading if they are too large. If your image’s long edge is more than 1568 pixels, or your image is more than ~1,600 tokens, it will first be scaled down, preserving aspect ratio, until it’s within the size limits.\n\nIf your input image is too large and needs to be resized, it will increase latency of [time-to-first-token](/docs/en/about-claude/glossary), without giving you any additional model performance. Very small images under 200 pixels on any given edge may degrade performance.\n\n<Tip>\n  To improve [time-to-first-token](/docs/en/about-claude/glossary), we recommend\n  resizing images to no more than 1.15 megapixels (and within 1568 pixels in\n  both dimensions).\n</Tip>\n\nHere is a table of maximum image sizes accepted by our API that will not be resized for common aspect ratios. With Claude Sonnet 4.5, these images use approximately 1,600 tokens and around $4.80/1K images.\n\n| Aspect ratio | Image size   |\n| ------------ | ------------ |\n| 1&#58;1      | 1092x1092 px |\n| 3&#58;4      | 951x1268 px  |\n| 2&#58;3      | 896x1344 px  |\n| 9&#58;16     | 819x1456 px  |\n| 1&#58;2      | 784x1568 px  |\n\n### Calculate image costs\n\nEach image you include in a request to Claude counts towards your token usage. To calculate the approximate cost, multiply the approximate number of image tokens by the [per-token price of the model](https://claude.com/pricing) you’re using.\n\nIf your image does not need to be resized, you can estimate the number of tokens used through this algorithm: `tokens = (width px * height px)/750`\n\nHere are examples of approximate tokenization and costs for different image sizes within our API's size constraints based on Claude Sonnet 4.5 per-token price of $3 per million input tokens:\n\n| Image size                    | \\# of Tokens | Cost / image | Cost / 1K images |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |\n| 200x200 px(0.04 megapixels)   | \\~54         | \\~$0.00016   | \\~$0.16          |\n| 1000x1000 px(1 megapixel)     | \\~1334       | \\~$0.004     | \\~$4.00          |\n| 1092x1092 px(1.19 megapixels) | \\~1590       | \\~$0.0048    | \\~$4.80          |\n\n### Ensuring image quality\n\nWhen providing images to Claude, keep the following in mind for best results:\n\n- **Image format**: Use a supported image format: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP.\n- **Image clarity**: Ensure images are clear and not too blurry or pixelated.\n- **Text**: If the image contains important text, make sure it’s legible and not too small. Avoid cropping out key visual context just to enlarge the text.\n\nMany of the [prompting techniques](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) that work well for text-based interactions with Claude can also be applied to image-based prompts.\n\nThese examples demonstrate best practice prompt structures involving images.\n\n<Tip>\n  Just as with document-query placement, Claude works best when images come\n  before text. Images placed after text or interpolated with text will still\n  perform well, but if your use case allows it, we recommend an image-then-text\n  structure.\n</Tip>\n\n### About the prompt examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use Claude's vision capabilities using various programming languages and approaches. You can provide images to Claude in three ways:\n\n1. As a base64-encoded image in `image` content blocks\n2. As a URL reference to an image hosted online  \n3. Using the Files API (upload once, use multiple times)\n\nThe base64 example prompts use these variables:\n\n```python Python\nimport base64\nimport httpx",
