  "content": "Extend Claude with specialized capabilities using Agent Skills in the Claude Agent SDK\n\nAgent Skills extend Claude with specialized capabilities that Claude autonomously invokes when relevant. Skills are packaged as `SKILL.md` files containing instructions, descriptions, and optional supporting resources.\n\nFor comprehensive information about Skills, including benefits, architecture, and authoring guidelines, see the [Agent Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).\n\n## How Skills Work with the SDK\n\nWhen using the Claude Agent SDK, Skills are:\n\n1. **Defined as filesystem artifacts**: Created as `SKILL.md` files in specific directories (`.claude/skills/`)\n2. **Loaded from filesystem**: Skills are loaded from configured filesystem locations. You must specify `settingSources` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources` (Python) to load Skills from the filesystem\n3. **Automatically discovered**: Once filesystem settings are loaded, Skill metadata is discovered at startup from user and project directories; full content loaded when triggered\n4. **Model-invoked**: Claude autonomously chooses when to use them based on context\n5. **Enabled via allowed_tools**: Add `\"Skill\"` to your `allowed_tools` to enable Skills\n\nUnlike subagents (which can be defined programmatically), Skills must be created as filesystem artifacts. The SDK does not provide a programmatic API for registering Skills.\n\n<Note>\n**Default behavior**: By default, the SDK does not load any filesystem settings. To use Skills, you must explicitly configure `settingSources: ['user', 'project']` (TypeScript) or `setting_sources=[\"user\", \"project\"]` (Python) in your options.\n</Note>\n\n## Using Skills with the SDK\n\nTo use Skills with the SDK, you need to:\n\n1. Include `\"Skill\"` in your `allowed_tools` configuration\n2. Configure `settingSources`/`setting_sources` to load Skills from the filesystem\n\nOnce configured, Claude automatically discovers Skills from the specified directories and invokes them when relevant to the user's request.\n\nSkills are loaded from filesystem directories based on your `settingSources`/`setting_sources` configuration:\n\n- **Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/`): Shared with your team via git - loaded when `setting_sources` includes `\"project\"`\n- **User Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`): Personal Skills across all projects - loaded when `setting_sources` includes `\"user\"`\n- **Plugin Skills**: Bundled with installed Claude Code plugins\n\nSkills are defined as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content. The `description` field determines when Claude invokes your Skill.\n\n**Example directory structure**:\n\nFor complete guidance on creating Skills, including SKILL.md structure, multi-file Skills, and examples, see:\n- [Agent Skills in Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): Complete guide with examples\n- [Agent Skills Best Practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices): Authoring guidelines and naming conventions\n\n<Note>\nThe `allowed-tools` frontmatter field in SKILL.md is only supported when using Claude Code CLI directly. **It does not apply when using Skills through the SDK**.\n\nWhen using the SDK, control tool access through the main `allowedTools` option in your query configuration.\n</Note>\n\nTo restrict tools for Skills in SDK applications, use the `allowedTools` option:\n\n<Note>\nImport statements from the first example are assumed in the following code snippets.\n</Note>\n\n## Discovering Available Skills\n\nTo see which Skills are available in your SDK application, simply ask Claude:\n\nClaude will list the available Skills based on your current working directory and installed plugins.\n\nTest Skills by asking questions that match their descriptions:\n\nClaude automatically invokes the relevant Skill if the description matches your request.\n\n**Check settingSources configuration**: Skills are only loaded when you explicitly configure `settingSources`/`setting_sources`.
